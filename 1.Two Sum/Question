Check if pair with given Sum exists in Array (Two Sum)

Given an array A[] of n numbers and another number x, the task is to check whether or not there exist two elements in A[] whose sum is exactly x. 

Examples: 

Input: arr[] = {0, -1, 2, -3, 1}, x= -2
Output: Yes
Explanation: If we calculate the sum of the output,1 + (-3) = -2

Input: arr[] = {1, -2, 1, 0, 5}, x = 0
Output: No
